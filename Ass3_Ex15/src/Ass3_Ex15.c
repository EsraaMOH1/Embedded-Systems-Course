 ============================================================================
 Write a program that uses nested structures to organize student details, including
name, age, and address.
It defines two structures: Address (containing street, city, state, and zipCode) and
Student (containing name, age, and a nested Address structure).
In the main function, a Student variable is declared. The program prompts the
user to enter the student's name, age, and address details. It uses gets to read
string inputs and scanf for numeric inputs. Finally, the program prints the
studentâ€™s details, including the nested address information.
